# Overview

The API is just a simple bindable event for both the server and client, but to make it easier to communicate with the API we have provided API wrappers.

# Requirements
- The API wrapper for either the client or server[^1]
- A knowledge on how to code

# Support
Our maintainers will provide basic support for API usage, we will not teach you how to code.

[Client API Wrapper](client.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[Server API Wrapper](server.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
